man your explanation and narration is fun to listen and watching your videos are fun to watch with all the edits and animations. aside from all the jokes and fun, i even learn many new things from you with enjoyment. it has never been boring learning from your videos :) keep it up and keep making such awesome content. godspeed!
can explain more about domain
cool video)
shaqataranyaa shaqahaa shashaashaa shaahaa ayaan rabaa ebony
although people will think its beginner level, but half of this 0.01 % takes years of experience to learn
wait a second node is popuplar? since when, or before when
to much information in such little time ma brain is going to 🤯 slow down please 🥹
this is so helpful on so many levels. feels like i’ve just finished a course, i wish you did something like this but in more detail and with more concepts or diving a bit deeper in each area, so as to cover full stack development, touching basically all the concepts briefly. would be very very cool. <br><br>this is the first video i’ve seen that’s organized so well and concisely to give all the info in the most authentic and effective way possible. thank you.
props for this video; it&#39;s great, concise... ...and i can tell that you really put a lot of effort into producing it.<br><br>well, i&#39;m amazed at the fact that:<br>(a) i know 90% of this stuff; and<br>(b) i didn&#39;t realize that i&#39;ve been carrying around so much knowledge
my motivation evaporated
thank you so much bro... appreciate this
a bit creepy that he will see us. should tape the webcam first.
us backend devs wating for him to talk about us
did not expect to hear the words describing classes as too low level lol
though i don&#39;t know many concepts, this video makes me feel i&#39;m smart. all concepts are well explained.
dude&#39;s summed up an entire college degree
amazing vid ty
&quot;&quot;&quot;how to format a date in javascript&quot;&quot;&quot;
been a web developer 27 years and the only one i didn&#39;t know anything about was #89; but i haven&#39;t worked front end in almost 5 years. this was great list. for fun i thought what else could be on this list. i came up with: code patterns and seo (like google analytics specifically, or user flow tracking).
man spat some bars and thought we wouldn&#39;t notice 🤖
dam that was brilliant
gotta love css pikachu..
i like this very much, since it shows you a bird&#39;s eye view of the development process. i like that it is clearly explain what many of the popular frameworks actually do and what work they save us. i would like to see more videos like this for more specific topics.
an excellent overview
best css description in the www
tqm
what a great explanation!!
bro how do you collect all this info about a domian <br>like whats your workflow
what jeff does, this is art
is this the casually explained guy? the have the same voice.
fireship : every one use google to figure out things<br>the person who develop google : <br>☠
i could relate to this video in 2 ways: 1) i&#39;m a web development dinosaur, on it and up-to-date with it since 99 or 2000, so i&#39;ve followed most of these come and go, along with studying basically all of these (or about them) through the years; and 2) i&#39;ve had years, now far in the deep bottom of a burnout i&#39;m long back from, where i&#39;d possibily answer &quot;what do you do for a living?&quot; with a train of thought quite close to this video, back-to-back.
brother before clicking on your video i always prepare myself to freak out. but by the end of it you calm me down like a pond. thanks, man, for these rollercoasters of emotions.<br>love your videos and information.<br>thanks.
where&#39;s my benevolent elephant homies at?
that freestyle tho
show this to a totally non-dev person in 2x speed
that fish css though... awesome!
is it just me or does this guy speak extremely fast. i constantly have to rewind or change the speed of video
love your work!
honestly, for me ive been doing front end for 2 years now and recebtly started backend.<br>im making a blog post project and ive gotta say backend feels easier thsn frontend. i dont have to worry about user experience because its just the server and the user&#39;s client
been binging this channel doing my first real client project and starting to hear your voice in my head randomly. not mad about it.
you managed to clarify the concept of a pointer in just one sentence, which i couldn&#39;t grasp from a segment of the cs50 lecture explaining it.
it makes my learning much easier. &quot;google it&quot;  -  one of the main skills))
dude... so much relevant info info... and there is a next one!!! 🤣
en
yaaa what you said
the single best organized and comprehensive explanation you&#39;ll find anywhere!
does this guy even breath? seriously tho. its good that he covered so much but damn. info overload
ok, my brain started melting 5 minutes in. 😂
i am learning so much from watching your videos. thank you so much for sharing this amazing source of information. this one is quite helpful.
now game development
how do i become this good😮
i wasn’t ready for them barz bro. i rewind that shit like 5 times 😂 u got my sub fr
i&#39;ve been web dev without knowledge of programming, im just lucky, now its 1 year past still i just know 10% of web developing, 9% in frontend 1% for backend. but still i have hopes for developing my force skill haha
i&#39;m not a programmer and i understood enough of that that it scares me a little.
i am have done till 48 guys i gonna come in a week  and update how far i have come
bro got me when he started rapping
thank you for this amazing content! <a href="about:invalid#zcsafez"></a>
this this is definitely not for beginners and he talks super fast he doesn’t allow the idea to sink in
i&#39;m a fool stack developer 💪
<b>bars</b>
very cool, thanks!
i know some of these words
you just gained a subscriber brother <br>that’s is a ton of information you’re giving in just one video 🔥
your videos motivate my coding realm ❤
that pikachu face misaligment.. i hope i won&#39;t get traumatized by it.
we can skip cs degree right now, yes!
why did he repeat typing 200 ok haha?
13 minutes well spent!
i am free to write in my bio full stack dev now xd
did he just rap?😂
whats the dog doing there
33 was skipped.
i was looking for a brief (but concise) overview or web dev and holy shit...is it daunting in the beginning stages. i&#39;ll probably have to re-watch this video several times throughout my learning process just to keep a good bird&#39;s eye view of how all this ties together. atm i often forget what all these programs are. what exactly they do, and why. that&#39;s the difficult part for me now, is having something like a road map to understand what options are available, what the best one may be, and why it&#39;s significant to me. <br><br>thank you so much for taking the time to make this video. helps a lot.
he is feynman of webdev
ayo them bars doe
come on! this deserves a fucking super like
2023 may 28
you&#39;d swear this guy has been to prison, with that many bars on bars on bars!!!! this video is the best. i&#39;ve been doing this stuff for years but explaining it and a clear concise way is hard to do and you have nailed it!! thank you so much!!
i extremely like the video, man. very helpful and informative. thank you very much. it is presented so well too. great, positive work.
👍 making the content<br>👍 sharing the knowledge <br>👍 the humour
im addicted to your channel bro
regular programming students: (struggling to learn some tools of one language)<br>site developers: 😂
i want my 101 certificate 🥲 hahaha
best summary ever :) congrats!
your videos are great. i love how you get so much information in such a small time.
the number of times i&#39;ve googled &quot;how to format a date in javascript&quot; is infinite.
part two?😊
i love that the short for daily active user is dau. because in german it speak that stands for &quot;dümmster anzunehmender user&quot; (english: dumbest credible user) which stems from gau (größter anzunehmender unfall - maximum credible accident).
very reassuring 😅
you forgot the most important one: stack overflow 😀
i&#39;ve learnt most of common web development concepts. where do i go from here to master web development? <br>are there any books on expert webdev or cs in general?
*web was the best job in the world
sort of wish<br>&lt;img&gt; was display: block;<br>&lt;most other tags&gt; were display: inline; or display: flex/grid;<br><br>and the fact that you had how to format at date, recently had to take a package out that was breaking all builds it was intended for that exact thing. please just use intl
what makes a developer good isn&#39;t how much they know but how fast they can get relevant information.
chrome extensions 101!
fireship to the top 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
tell my chat gpt assistant about it
100 terms and didn&#39;t even scratch the surface. actually, this is a 1000-mile high-level view of the surface.
for the rap alone you deserve a like. that was hysterical.
this is a channels i cannot process at 2x speed haha. feels like a firehose to the face
this video made me seriously consider do ios development, lol. all you need is a mac and some swift code!! 😅
i&#39;ve been a professional web developer for 17 years, and i knew 90-95% of these things. the issue with this job is as soon as you master one technology it becomes obsolete and is replaced by a completely different one.
if you love to solve problems, one step at a time, you&#39;ll love software development.
me who knows every single one of them yet can&#39;t code a single script: interesting.
man, your editor is so good
if it makes anyone feel better, i am a professional developer, and much of this video went over my head (mostly because it was super fast (.50× speed was decent), but also because of point 101: google it!). you absolutely don&#39;t <b>need</b> to know (much less deeply understand) all of this stuff to become a developer, but all of the things he mentioned are good to be aware of (hence the title). it honestly greatly depends on what type of developer you become.<br><br>regardless, the key is to get a mind to learn and to be willing to be challenged and stretched along the way. good luck! :)
jokes aside this was a very informative video
senin ben tasagini yerim paşa ya
my brain only keeps up because it knows all these seperate components of web app programming concepts and this video displays all connections sequentially and multipi as well
well done.
i love you papiii
beautiful video
omg flex-box pikachu is sending me!
that&#39;s an insanely awesome, informative and useful summary of most tech used in javascript stack. thank you!
i love your videos, so informative and engaging!  keep up the great work 🙏
better than eminem
honestly i didn’t understand anything 😂😂😂😂
which book can i use to learn web dev stuff like this? i&#39;m a beginner with no knowledge.<br><br>• integration of analytics tools<br>• integration of crm or marketing automation tools<br>• an e-commerce platform<br>• multi-language support<br>• geolocation api integration<br>• social media integration<br>• cookie consent notification<br>• security features
crazy video, so many brief content of so many huge topics. there is a lot to dive in ,thanks!
yeah, i know all this stuff, graduated in sep and still can&#39;t get a job!
i know a company that provides web development if anyone is interested.
full stack dev here with 4+ years of experience..... apart from understanding this there are around 1000 more things you need to know and i confirm i don&#39;t shit... if i work only on frontend for 3-4 months i forget backend and need to google simple stuff and vice versa... so anyone who wants to go into web dev don&#39;t be overwhelmed ever one is figuring out things as they go.... also you will also be googling how to center a div or how to write regex for a long time😂😂
you talk as you suffer from childhood trauma so talk slower
i am learning so much from watching your videos. thank you so much for sharing this amazing source of information. this one is quite helpful.
do you consider powershell relevant on webdev environment?
thank you, alison 😊
if we invent a time machine, firteship is my vote for who gets to use it
i wasn&#39;t ready for pikachu
helped very much! thank you for video (starting web dev)
4 kiss for you to not use background sick song
really really helpful to get a good foundation on wt... is happening.<br>thank you man, i am really happy that i clicked on this video.<br>and i should mentioned that you nailed your style with using gifs memes and fast pace edit.
dude. this video is the best thing ever. i learned more from this video than i ever have anywhere else
where is php is all those mentioned? most of websites run on that like wordpress, wocommerce, drupal etc
so cool 🥺🥺🥺
this taught me so much - thank you!
php where
nobody&#39;s explaining load balancing to me..
what a refresher 😄😄. nice man keep going on...
ok
i am a fullstack developer who knows html, css, js, and didn&#39;t know any thing mentioned in this video 🤯.
the surprised pikachu face with all of the parts all jumbled up perfectly describes my experience learning css for the first time
i&#39;m drunk, but this video feels great, maybe i should watch it when i&#39;m sober
you are a genius
posion :fixed;<br>:root {<br>--amr=1px<br>}<br>. . . .<br>. . . . <br>margin: var(amr);
jeff you have mastered the short-form video format. you must be banking like a mofo. :)
node/js most popular backend language... am i in the future, year 2505?
there&#39;s something weird about your voice. i&#39;m sure i have heard it in other yt videos, on other channels about completely unrelated topics. are you like a cia mind controlling agent who sways and hypnotizes plebs like sirens lured sailors or whomever? or you are a voice over actor? you are certainly not a real hacker, because i haven&#39;t seen a single video of yours where you&#39;re showing us how to hack governments, banks, or at least chatgpt so everybody would send me monero when they ask how to become successful. maybe you&#39;re waiting for cbdc so we get caught.
thanks
lmao loved the ending.  i was googling something for css when you said that 🤣
thank you! now everything became clear-ish
lol at the comments saying &quot;hey easy things you learn in years explained in 13 mins!!!!&quot;.<br>full stack dev here in multiple technologies.<br>what you see in the video is just a nice summary, not too detailed, of what you most commonly use (lot of stuff missing) when you do full stack dev.<br><br>just saying &quot;bundlers&quot;, &quot;you need a webserver&quot;, &quot;dockerized&quot;, &quot;you need a database&quot;, &quot;use cloud companies&quot; by themselves opens 5 new whole worlds full of complexity and new topics
last word was so, satisfying
honestly while i&#39;m still learning vanilla js i feel like learning to google is 90% of work, aside from few things that will repeat themselves in every project there is just too many little things to remember to the point it&#39;s more efficient to simply know where to look and what is possible<br> then to write anything out of the memory, moment i stoped trying to learn everything and remember it all and instead just tried to grasp concept behind what is needed i noticed very quick improvement in my coding.
just one percent?
learned more for free in less than 15 mins from this video than i have in 4 semesters worth of classes that i paid a ton of money for. 🙃
this is such a talos iv moment
&quot;node is the most popular&quot; - he said, while 4 out of 5 websites are running on php.
i have been learning web development for 4 years from now and i am not confident to call myself a web developer although i am a full time professional salesforce developer.
everyone probably noticed this but &quot;position: absolute&quot; actually positions an element not relative to its nearest ancestor but the closest ancestor that has a position set to relative and if there is none, it&#39;s positioned relative to the body.
great content. congrats on your success.
you do a great job at taking complex subjects such as this and making it easy for almost anybody to consume.  great work!
the amount of informations you&#39;re spitting in this video it just oversaturate my last brain cells. :)
just know the names.... google the rest...web development 101...
guess it would have been hard to make front end dev more hilarious
very gud video
making fun of disabled, han?<br>that&#39;s funny😬
thanks!
they form the dom not virtual dom
excellent.
2 years of webdev still learning
rtfm 👍
the top categories <br>1. compiler, ides and programming language developers (scientist level)<br>2. server, os, browsers and other tools developers (principal developer level)<br>3. database developers (advanced developers)<br>4. desktop and web apps developers (developers)<br>5. accidental developers 🤣😂😁😁😂😂
node modules. the dream of every ci pipeline..
that was awesome!
i took a whole semester web development course and learned about a quarter of what i learned in this video
point 66: calling object a dictionary is very unhelpful in the long term, as i&#39;m discovering at a quick pace. it is used as a dictionary, but it&#39;s actually quite the monster underneath. map is the proper dictionary, but it doesn&#39;t have any syntax because object is squatting on it.
woow big up master
thank you, i will send this to my grandma so she can know.
*100++; web developement things you should know
the flow was too good broo 🔥🔥🔥🚨😂
the video i never knew i needed to  see but wow, helped a lot. just started learning web dev and this vid just gave me a general understanding of how everything works 🤣
i&#39;m thinking how you take breath while giving speech in this speed. 😶😶
awesome video thank you!
you did not mention async function which i think is very important concept
thank you
you should always know what your tool/language/platform/etc is capable of, but you don&#39;t necessarily have to memorize precisely how to do it. that&#39;s where google comes in.
thanks❤
i am the impostor syndrome
so good!
awesome overview - i also love your sense of humor :)
elegant like a benevolent elephant in the room without zoom
thanks for the last line😂
do you think pursuing junior front-end developer will still be a good choice in 2023?
i am actually in freshman college year .i really love web development and the idea behind it .shall i dive deep into it for the next three years.can someone help me out?
i recently got into the original star trek! it&#39;s super old, yet so mysteriously engaging!
yes. just yes. i am in love with your channel.

haha r&amp;m kronenburgs are the perfect mascot for javascript.
you sound like the &quot;hey hey hey...people&quot; african warlord
this was intelligent and relevant if you like elegant html elements.
hay quá
better, but is also more professional
this video made me bang me head on a wall a bit better
thanks!
how about &quot;all programming languages in 100 seconds&quot;? lol
the rap in the middle was so cool thing !
echtittypee
i have a web dev position interview in less than an hour. thanks for this
bars.
what do humans atypically use to access a url?
please add timestamps so i can refer it back easily
here the prove that the creator of the channel is an alien “humans topically use web browser”
can i translate this video and put subtitles in portuguese?
so much information, <br>i love it
name of song/theme/trap he used d:?
you got me at the &quot;css-ed&quot; pikachu

pikachu with aligned features - i chuckled
100+ data science  things you should know please 🥺
website development is the best profession ever - you will find the best online courses on my site for free, courses offered by professional teachers that you can download for free
i know html, css , js, bootstrap and i can&#39;t do front-end and design a web site what should i doooooooooooooooooo?
man i&#39;ve been doing webdev for almost 10 years and it never occured to me that div stands for division :d
why he didn&#39;t talk about php ?
i watched this 100 times and now i am 100% done with web dev!
full stack developer aka jack of all trades but a master of none
what&#39;s number 33? you skipped it?
this is such a great refresher video for the topic.
congrats, you now know about 10% of what you need for web dev. now go learn functional testing, user testing, a/b testing, debugging, ui/ux, localization, analytics, version control, pwas, apis, data layers, social media marketing, seo...<br><br>the point is: never stop learning.
didn&#39;t know jeff got bars 🔥
thanks for this!
i just started with html and css, hoping to become a front end developer sometime in the future and this video gives me hope
thanks for the 1%
thanks a lot dude💌💌... words can&#39;t express my gratitude for you 💯😉... this video is an &quot;answer booklet&quot; to all my programming question.... you explained every concepts on great continuation path... keep this work going dude...💝💝💌💌🎈🎈
awesome 👍👍 video 🔥🔥🔥
the fact that while studying html and css by jon duckett, i got to know these 100+ things but with practice and understanding
thank you yes
the only thing worse than <i>developing</i> for the web is <i>qa and testing</i> what&#39;s been developed for the web . holy shit that&#39;s dire and especially on the security side.
thank you i can now put full-stack webdev on my resume
yup, this summarizes the basics you need to know to work as a fullstack web developer.<br><br>i studied web development full time for five years and have worked as a full stack web dev for six years, and i’ve barely scratched the surface of the overwhelmingly amount of stuff you should know.<br><br>without stack overflow and the likes i don’t think i would’ve been able to work as a web dev.
this was surprisingly almost understandable for a noob like myself.
that part with rap music made me laugh so hard... excellent content in a very nice format.
that rap fresh af tho
why did the sound come up when he was talking about css 😂😂
stackexchange foreever!
most of this is so foundational. it&#39;s a nice overview but it&#39;s bloated and drills in on certain things e.g. absolute positioning, and then skims the surface on other parts e.g. tcp -- but does a web dev really need to understand tcp anyway? another clickbait title
&quot;how to format a date in javascript&quot; every god damn time.
wow
another pollyanna tech ad.
lol watching this shit before i leave for work as a developer 😂 don&#39;t need the help, but it&#39;s a good video lol. also tryna think of which of my friends wana learn to code coz what a great intro to web dev
bars 🔥🔥🔥
i really appreciate how straight to the point and informative your videos are. it never feels like you&#39;re just padding out the video runtime to game the youtube algorithm, but just trying to make the most information-dense videos you can.
maybe the best video i’ve ever found
for me this is video was a quick revision for things i already know but for new people they will not absorb all these info in 13 minutes
oh my god div means division
the rap part was cool. i&#39;m learning html n css right and i&#39;m doubting g if i can even learn this
is anyone else still watching this video knowing almost everything but still watching incase if they are left behind in anything?
great video 😄😂
master piece
a = 1 print a... yep, i got this. 😅
can you do a similar one for low level development. like os, kernel, or embedded platforms?
computer science is terrifyingly wide and deep.
that rap tho
just a small mountain of cocaine and 100 seconds of fireship, and you become an full stack developer for a single trip to the toilet
lmao &quot;almost nobody knows what they are doing. an we all just use google to figure stuff out on the fly.&quot;
googling is the only remedy for imposter syndrome.
main tag inside of an article tag, bad fireship!
informative.... i learnt a lot in a short time...
or you can simply become a front end or backend developer and will need to focus only on one half of the video.dont over complicate things not everyone needs to be a full stack developer
i can copy paste
incredible video. this has to be one of the most helpful tech videos ever!
you should do one for game development.
lighthouse is not a good tool as it simulates relatively old hardware, thus low metrics do not really mean that much as google cares more about real user experience. so if your fcp and lcp for real users are great, you are golden...
i understood pretty much all of that 😁
everything sp;ecial about it came out of a bottle.   -tony stark
i&#39;ve been a web developer for over 15 years, and this video is exactly my job.
thanks for sharing your knowledge.
i&#39;m so proud of myself, soon i will have 6 figures!
amazing video!!! what a way to summarise 100+ concepts in 13min... jeff never disappoints 🙌🏼 (btw, i would love to see a video of yours rapping about any content you feel like)
this guy is a genius
if this channel would focus more on php instead of front-end languages, this channel would be 100% perfect
i have zero experience with web development, but i feel like i can probably whip up a janky website in a day after watching this.
thanks!
this is amazing thank you
great channel man , new subscriber here!
that piece of rap
extremely informative toplevel view of web development
this was a very enlightening summary
thanks
anybody thinking damn i know a lot of stuff....
12 = 82 :/
감사합니다.
do u need to learn data structure &amp; algorithms, doing leetcode problems, codewars challenges etc to be a web developer?
my brain blew up
accurate except for the lack of mentions of stackoverflow.
a variable that can&#39;t be reassigned is not a variable because it doesn&#39;t vary :-) there is a special name for something that doesn&#39;t change - a constant. and since the keyword is already &quot;const&quot; then why even commit the blasphemy of calling a constant &quot;a variable that can&#39;t be reassigned&quot;? :-)
you are awesome!
cool video!  i just assigned this video for my web development students to watch!  😎
for ai to watch or better not for most!  surely those are not cs software engineers!😂
dude not skipping a single beat describing all of these concepts xd
@62 seconds, isn&#39;t the pdu for tcp/ip segments and not packets (ip)?
json --&gt;  as in jason, not jay-sawn.
thank you for the video! it&#39;s really satisfying to see that my 3 years of vocational edjucation combined with working in a dev department during my apprenticeship have given me a good start as a software developer. ^^
great video
valeu!
i love this series as i always have to learn things by putting them into perspective and associating them and this is extremely helpful
really appiricated how much fireship has done all these amazing video which is both informative and free to watch, as a self learning programer, your chanel helps me a lot !
i always code with google tab on.
thank you
101: don&#39;t trust a talosian.
what&#39;s the purpose of this video?<br>is this a tutorial? is this for motivation? <br>for a web developer, it&#39;s useless. <br>for non dev it&#39;s incomprehensible. <br>but it has a catchy title since clickbait is rediculously effective on youtube.
lol man web development can seriously go crazy at times.
glad to know i am a competent dev who just skipped a fee steps
the end statement with the dog was the most funniest…😀😂😭😂😭😂
these long form videos are top notch.  keep it up
great and to the point
vanilla js forever lol
i&#39;m going to send my family thie video when they ask me what it is i&#39;m trying to do with my life.
this was great. i used to be a c application programmer, and i always found it overwhelming the number of technologies that a web dev needs to know. i only knew c++. its way easier to know just one language (and the pay, at least back then, was better). thanks for creating such a nice run through of tools.
i just love this channel, i almost completely stopped using youtube for a while but this channel just got me back
vbs in 100 seconds
opengl in 100 seconds
thank you for making this and listing all these into easy concept forms. it makes my learning dev. learning much easier! cheers mate
we  know you re watched that rap segment
shout out to full stack developers
absolutely amazing fireship is as usual on fire....🔥
oh boy!
😂😂great content. 1% of what i need to know. i’m 1% closer to not being an imposter.
wow you are the lord of bundling information into videos human brains can understand. 🤣👏👏
which also means you will end up working for 3$ per hour because nobody does real development anymore and hacks everything from 1000 wp plugins
i didn&#39;t miss the &quot;liberty &lt;&gt; death&quot; select pun.<br>i also didn&#39;t miss your last video where you talked about possibility of being drafted into the ww3.<br>this will not happen jeff, things will only get better, you better start learning snoop&#39;s web 6.<br>and when at it, continue teaching us your ways master
do web components!  :)
i&#39;ve just recently dived into css . it is very confusing to say the least 🤓. it took me plenty of time to overlap a simple element. thanks to the community and google i could find a solution later, but it still requires time to find and apply the code and learn correct terminology.<br>and then there is responsive design for all different screens that&#39;d also require testing 🗿<br>i haven&#39;t even touched js yet but i&#39;m scared
can you make a video of the xamrin framework?
imagine someone looking at this video just to check out what they need to get started with web development,
you make the best videos on youtube.
15 years of web development. it&#39;s given me more opportunities than i could ever have imagined.
and they say programmers can&#39;t rap
you skipped over numbers 33 and 64.
finally i know what &quot;div&quot; is short for
wow wow wow slow down brainiac... 😂
this was brilliant !
can you make laravel in 100s !!??
as a web 101 graduate, i highly recommend this course to anyone out there
i&#39;m feeling pretty grateful about myself, &#39;cause i do know all of this stuff.
you ate a god
@fireship<br><br>could you do a &quot;elm in 100 seconds&quot; someday in the future?<br><br>i just discovered elm and it&#39;s quite a cool experence so far :-)
thanks!
this reminded me of my first primary days of web development
im a web developer after watching 13 min video, <br>jokes apart really informative in short amount of time
you are so good at this. i love your videos.
20 years of hobby development experience and i learned from this video that in html, the &quot;p&quot; is for paragraph and &quot;div&quot; is for division - i&#39;ve just always thought of them as &quot;pee&quot; and &quot;divv&quot;
thanks for the good content.
this video made node modules so clear to me in like 20 seconds where hours upon hours of research has failed to do so. thankyou so much
til that ip stands for internet protocol 🤦🏽‍♂️
&quot;inline style&quot;<br><br>no. no god no please no. no. no. noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i dunno why, but this explain my whole syllabus better than my school teacher
the part he starts rapping tho
im slowly finishing my bachelors degree and its crazy to see how ive basically hit every point in this video in some way or the other. definitely proud of myself:)
great video, thank you very much!
i could literally feel parts of my brain melting away listening to this, amazing explanation understood lot of stuff from it, keep up the gud work
finally i understand position: relative; thanks 🙏
man  u r awesome very informative
thank you fireship for this video.<br>i am now a web developer. 🙂
excuse me but nodejs is not the most popular since 80% of all websites use php and apache compared to 1.7% of websites that uses nodejs :) -you got some wrong info there bud
i have knowledge about 84 things from this list, i&#39;m fighting for react full-stack junior position
to this day, i still don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not possible that they call it vertical-align and horizontal-align instead of align-items and justify-content
it&#39;s like...<br>i know kung fu (c) neo
been doing this professionally for 4 years now after college and i finally understand all of this. been laxer focused for 4 years. it takes a lot to learn all of this.
cool. can i add this video as a certificate on my linkedin profile?
10 years in the game and i just learned what &quot;relative&quot; actually does lol
web development is modern word for the movie &quot;never ending story&quot;
that rap beat was fucking badass, really the bars where excellent, the execution flawless. i never would have imagined. this guy truly has all the talent in the world.
i&#39;m feeling pretty good that i knew everything on this list already. getting started, it&#39;s a lot to ask for, but i&#39;ve been doing this for a decade and a half and this is all sorts of background information that i&#39;ve absorbed over the years.
it is not possible to eliminate poverty without legalized theft. theft is an impossible standard, thus eliminating poverty can not be a reasonable goal. eliminating poverty is also impossible from a human perspective. most people don&#39;t want anything more than a mediocre life. thus, trying to eliminate poverty is hostilile act against the human condition.<br>it is not possible to cure all diseases because nature always finds new ways to harm living beings, thus curing all diseases can not be a reasonable goal. <br>it is not possible to make reasonable programs with the use of html, css, and javascript. javascript can&#39;t even deliver multithreading. <br>if you want to contribute to something reasonable on the internet you make a new browser that rests on pure functional programming.
my first video on youtube that i&#39;ve seen at 0.75x speed after he introduced javascript. i&#39;m new to the web dev world and hopefully one day i&#39;ll be able to know everything mentioned in this video and more.
one of the best channels i follow too much sauce💯💯
finally my knowledge hasassembled correctly in my head
this was about 8 hours of university education in 13 minutes.<br><b>**</b> awesome! :o
you fool, you didn&#39;t mention the programming socks
he is too fast i cant digest whole content at once
you&#39;re lacking sense of humor, your jokes are flat
&quot;performance is extremely important&quot; :)
yeah ... long story short ... nice vids man keep doing them please. i am dev with 14+ years of experience and always eager to watch one of yours ... just for fun :)
completely skipped over web components.
i can probably do all of those things, except for one: make a website look pretty. that stuff is incomprehensible to me
very nice cross-section! thx
102. web 3
you should release a developer rapping in 100 seconds video
do lisp
gotcha so i only need to know how to use google
missing your videos on algorithms
another banger of a video💪. thank you fireship👑
too bad this wasn&#39;t out a year ago when i started i could&#39;ve had literally a years worth of beginner lessons, tutorials, docs and google searches all in one  lmao just hit a year in my front end journey to insanity
great video. i&#39;d be super interested if you went into the networking side of this (basically the first 20 points) in depth in another video like this. i&#39;d find that insanely helpful as every time i navigate networking issues i get confused :)
my favorite part &quot;specificity rules, that determine which styles are relevant to an element in a way that&#39;s self evident and elegant like a benevolent elephant&quot; xd
he deserves a sub! i am not so good at js so really helped!!
these have to be the highest quality videos on youtube.
this was basically my last two years of learning condensed into 13 mins 😅. i’m a mobile dev now (react native) but yeah….accurate lol
css has always confused the shit out of me but somehow that explanation made so much of it click. thank you!
i love your editor and the script reader
bro this is so awesome. this is the sort of thing that has taken me years to learn. i was so confused by the internet as a system. and i&#39;ve been trying to put it all together. and seeing this, it&#39;s telling me that my hard work has paid off, because i understood most of the video haha. but you do it in such a nice way. so clear, so purposeful. man, i was like, &quot;ahh i want to send a tip to this guy!&quot; and then found the button on top haha. cheers!
also the users, the humans... they&#39;re made out of meat...
i like how he ended on web3
thanks!
how to center a div? 😕
great video .. i think images are inline-block
it&#39;s crazy how much stuff we actually know
rap though
could you please do a video like this awesome one on networking
<b>omg stop showing this damned algoexpert and stuff</b>
100+... ya achieved
new javascript frameworks are coming faster than covid variants
i am looking for w0w button 🧐
&quot;almost nobody knows what the hell they&#39;re doing and we all just use google to figure things out on the fly&quot;<br>you just insulted my entire race of people<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>but yes!!
i think… i love you
where is the no.33?
&lt;div&gt;<br> ha!, this video make my day<br>&lt;/div&gt;
your pm will hate you! over these simple tricks: you just need to...
nobody gonna talk about jeff joining the rap game? 😂
accurate.
i&#39;ve been dping web development for 4 years and still don&#39;t know how to center div
&quot;almost nobody knows what the hell they&#39;re doing and we all just use google to figure things out on the fly.&quot;<br>that&#39;s called jit compile.
last part is the best xd
i wonder 90% out of 100+ things are related to frontend? i guess there are tons of more things to be said about backend &amp; infra &amp; security technologies.
obviously you can&#39;t fit everything in such a short video , but to me the biggest thing missing here is, no mention at all of git. in my experience, git is actually what most aspiring web devs struggle the most with, rebasing a branch, squahing commits, solving merge conflicts. this is where they can get lost, waste of lot of time and prevent their integration in a team, because a significant amount of the work is rebasing your branch on the reference branch on a regular basis
„how to center a div” has entered the chat
so no one&#39;s gonna talk about the star trek character in the thumbnail?
it&#39;s more like a journey every web dev goes through, <br>like they start from simple html sites.then(css).then(javascript).then(usesomefrontendframework).then(usefullstackframework).then(learnhowtohost).then(makemoney).catch(&quot;you messed up&quot;)
holy shit this was like two fucking years of college in 13 minutes, now i just wanna cry and laugh at the same time
i came
wow, tht is very cool
in other words: things have become more and more unnecessarily complicated over time, because people became more and more lazy over time. and now, more and more projects are so flimsy, they have to be tied together by things like docker and because people can&#39;t even do infrastructure shit on their own any more, they&#39;ll have to lock themselves in with the huge infrastructure providers.<br><br>nice
i&#39;m here for memes only
jeff: the second language you need to learn is cs-<br> <br>web dev gurus: imma need you to stop right there.
am i the only one hearing two different voices?
“everyone just uses google” is super true but also keep in mind<br><br>that’s not an excuse to be lazy and not bother learning, but it is great to know there’s a huge support system for when things slip your mind because let’s be honest.<br><br>web devs, software devs, all the devs are looking stuff up daily because there’s just so much out there to know. :)
put that on my resume.
php deserves a mention, even if it is going to be negative
wow...man you need a medal
i’ve been doing web development for almost 20 years. i saw the rise and fall of flash, the born of “tableless” and xmlhttprequest, jquery, scriptaculous, and the list goes on; i immigrated because of it. and i still have no idea what i’m doing 😂
i only use vi editor. ides are way too complicated.
bro spoke so fast
great recap.  also i know this is really just a long way so you can say &quot;single threaded non blocking event loop&quot;
please send my diploma, i just watched the entire video.
&quot;almost nobody knows what they&#39;re doing&quot; yeah that&#39;s programming lol
fireship, you are precious
wich i had this video 10 years ago xd
oh my, if i knew this viedo back then - very good video
can we get the rest of the rap? please
great video!! i&#39;ll be waiting for the next 99000+ things that goes in between all of the ones you mentioned :)
i&#39;m a full stack dev and have been for over 14 years now. google everything and anything.  you don&#39;t remember shit with more time.  you just get better at googling and what to google.
u should make a video about arduino
nice rap
jesus christ — this is gold. i never share any yt videos with anyone, but just shared it with ~10 people! also totally loved “this is only 0.01x of web development”, and “it’s okay to be overwhelmed cz we don’t know what the hell we’re doing anyway, and just google crap” 😂😅
what’s a phone book?
it&#39;s the rap beat for me 😂😂
guys, please add subtitles
i&#39;ve never done web dev excluding using the html5 canvas and javascript to make silly 2d video games but i still feel like i&#39;ve understood everything in this video (mostly due to all your 100 seconds videos)! also writing c++ 8 hours a day probably helps with my understanding xd<br><br>in other words, when&#39;s the server-side rust tutorial being uploaded!?
more rapping!
i think it&#39;s funny when people say real programmers need to know everything. i can&#39;t say i&#39;ve met a single developer who doesn&#39;t have stackoverflow permanently opened on their screen while they&#39;re coding. programming is both an art and a science. it isn&#39;t always about exactly what you know, but how you can apply the knowledge that you do have.
these videos are so incredibly valuable for us programmers that know the gist of these concepts, but maybe not the specific implementations or definitions of them. keep up the good work!
about the statement, that node is the most popular, as it relies on the same language as frontend - this is highly debatable. i&#39;d argue, that depending on the place you are, it varies. some companies will hire people with different skill sets for backend/frontend, which will lead to different stacks in both layers. despite that, its really cool video! i liked how you laid down foundations with networking, html and moved into higher concepts.
it appeared to me that you are copying what was in my head! did you do that?
why didnt you release this video last week, i would of well passed my information technology exam.
oh my godddd!!! i love these 101 videos<a href="about:invalid#zcsafez"></a><a href="about:invalid#zcsafez"></a>
i get lost and found along the way. awesome content
would be nice if this also included ip routing.  this video glosses over that but still mentions dns.
you should do a video on the old mobile web.. wap
is there a great american who can donate his old labtop to an egyptian student who wants to learn web development, it&#39;s very hard to get labtop ,it&#39;s requires work for 10 months, and i am still a student and i help my family to survive
got the messsage
the end sentence says it all 😂
that severless computing meme gets me every time
the ending was satisfying.
my god man!! this vid is awesome!! i was asking myself the whole time, &quot;how much time this would take to put together&quot;. it&#39;s so well organized and explained!! so impressive and informative. i love it!!
