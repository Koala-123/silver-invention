wow this is very interesting. i didn’t knew it could do that😊
would most of these features work with a 9th gen base model ipad?<br>it&#39;s the only apple device i have and i&#39;m looking forward to expanding into the eco system.
at the end i didn&#39;t see the galaxy book. are you going to test it in your samsung ecosystem video?
ily❤
no.
hands down yes it is worth it well until ai comes into its own.
well .. waiting for samsung ecosystem.. i use both but always confused what to use as my mean device 😂😂😂😂😂
using my ipad as a second display while connected to my macbook pro has been life saving for doing projects on the go
casting iphone screen on a macbook: demo for some app if you are a developer
every windows or android user need to see this.
at first i thought u were ltt wife
that was really really great, i’ve got a few apple devices and some samsung. would be interested to see how samsung/android also integrates windows
short answer to the title of this video — yes!
we all know apple is king with ecosystem and madam is team samsung she kinda didnt really made valid point here abd fun facts apple invented ecosystem 😉
great video, as always, and happy new year! are you left handed?
on the airpod switching issue this is fixable. apple defaults to automatically connecting for some strange reason (given they hope everyone has multiple apple devices). you can change that (on each device) to connect to last device connected. sometimes unexplainably apple resets this setting to their default after updates so you need to change it again. but do this and the airpods won&#39;t randomly switch away from a device you are already using.
hi ella, could you please do window laptop with ios devices please. there are actually a decent number of people are in this ecosystem 😊
why on the end she said it’s all samsung eco system ?
for the automatic switching between devices for the airpods, that seems to work for me now.<br><br>like you mentioned, the iphone seems to be the preferred device. anytime you start watching content on your iphone, the airpods will switch from your mac to your iphone with no problem. the problem is the reverse, automatically switching from your iphone to your mac. i would always have to manually reconnect my airpods to my mac when resuming content on my mac. <br><br>it seems like with some recent software updates across the devices, that seamless switching seems to work with no problem now. my airpods now switch between my mac, iphone and my ipad automatically.
no more video for apple
as a new iphone buyer, i found some of the features shown in the video really helpful. thanks!
realy great video
many tvs support airplay 2 now. i cast photos to a bigger screen and it looks great.
you’re beautiful. i like the tone of your voice it’s nice listening 😊 great job 😊
please do a video on samsung ecosystem.....
this function works half of the time, <br>but it&#39;s apple so 4.9 out of 5
ipad to iphone copy function -&gt; i never had any issues, nor do i have to restart my ipad. are you sure you are doing it right? 😊<br><br>good video, salute! 🫡
i actually didn&#39;t know some of the downsides of these features, so thank you for showing that too
what about the apple tv ? you can also. screen mirror on that .. and you can facetime on there.
very concise and to the point.<br><br>for how much people swear by the apple&#39;s ecosystem (it&#39;s a good one, don&#39;t get me wrong, but) there really isn&#39;t anything samsung&#39;s one doesn&#39;t do as well, hm. interesting.
the apple tv also exists, everyone leaves it out the ecosystem
continuity camera is 5* for me i never go on zoom or meets without it
to the point. that&#39;s exactly what people want to knowabout apple eco ststem. not showing what apple devices are own by them.
hey ella was just wondering if you had only one choice which ecosystem would you choose between the two?
you can actually airplay to a mac as well like how it was done for the homepod
apple ecosystem is miles ahead of the competition. samsung is trying hard.
strapping the watch to the phone as a mini viewfinder 🤯
hi, have you tried pairing up two iphones together and using one iphone to control the camera functions of the other, is that even possible?  just thought about it, it would be so cool if one could do that right? 😺
informative video. but why are you sitting on the table, then sitting in the chair, back to table? distracting. just have a small table to put whatever device or decor next to the tv if you want to showcase the topic on the big screen. 4 / 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
amazing video!
please also test out the samsung eco system or you could do a comparison between samsung or apple, pros and cons, etc
my essential apple ecosystem are the mbp and an iphone, everything else are variety of brands
great job on the video and checking out all the apple devices . i really enjoyed your personality in the way you did this video, but i got to say the iphone you were using in this video looks like a mini ipad , how could you put that in your pocket?
you’re missing apple tv!
perfect video as always. your beauty is a bit distracting though.
you should&#39;ve mentioned another feature - when taking a photo or video with iphone, you can stream the screen to the macbook screen. this makes it super valuable for group photos taken on a standing selfie stick with the main camera
&quot;if u have friends&quot;
hiya, where did you get the ipad case? thanks
summary: great, but could be more reliable.<br><br>apple should change software-management.
love your video❤
but what about the apple services such as apple fitness, apple music, icloud, apple arcade, apple news :)
cool video. i’d likely never use most features listed here (didn’t even know most of them existed), but it’s good to know it’s there if i need it.
homepod 🗑️ 💩
people always brag about apple&#39;s ecosystem but it&#39;s mid at best. samsung is wayy better with wayy more devices
apple forever❤❤❤❤
you look like jennie from blackpink
clean yo screen. laptop is worth +2k, im sure u can afford a micro fibre cloth
great test! i like your approach to making these reviews. you&#39;&#39;re a bright mind.
can&#39;t wait for samsung ecosystem. happy new year!
huawei ecosystem is better. there&#39;s so many issues you even mentioned that are solved so well in huawei. apple ecosystem i would give 3.5/5 because it could be better. huawei 4.5 because i don&#39;t prefer their laptops and not sure if the ecosystem is possible to use on other devices if you just don&#39;t have just the laptop
great video, but still missing a few important features. for example, continuity is just a bonus on macs, test the iphone camera on an apple tv, that&#39;s where the value is (facetime, karaoke...). about casting, try casting to your apple tv, and watch those 4k videos on a big oled screen. universal control works pretty good between computers too, not only with your ipad. also, something nice to try, pair your home pods to your apple tv or just watch a movie using your airpods...
pretty girl 🤩
next to my android phones i have an ipad pro and i now also have a second gen iphone se just to see what it&#39;s all about, and... there is no eco system.<br>the only eco system is the internet.
i always thought the so called &quot;eco system&quot; is just a set of bad purchasing decisions as there are no marketing leading products from apple and so it is always better to go for the best product in each of the areas. what is much more important are apps that are cross platform. as a pc and android i cannot ever imagine downgrading to apple products.
what sucks is being forced to use icloud drive for photos unless u choose to use iphone storage
you didn’t include the apple tv. i would say it’s part of the core ecosystem, as it’s part of the personal computing experience.
for me it&#39;s very worth it. sync between phone and laptop is flawless
cool iphone case!
ella happy new year
you look like jennie from blackpink 😊😊
it feels so nice to see that almost all the features mentioned here are available on samsung devices....many work and are more optimised than their apple counterpart based on what i&#39;ve observed from this video...btw...they work even on my samsung a34 which is like 300 dollars.i wonder how it works on a s23 ultra.....so maybe apple might not be the ecosystem king for that long 😏😁
i appreciate the uniqueness of your videos. you are not just another one note youtuber who only does one thing. you diversify yourself by doing different types of videos. keep doing you girl. never change for nobody unless you want to. good work! 👌🏽
great idea covering these features in the video. let&#39;s say i&#39;m using 2 out of 10 now. i&#39;ll try some new ones i saw in your video. 👍
you’re videos are so pleasant and genuinely enjoyable to watch 😁
a fair, balanced and unbiased report. <br>i know a lot of other tech youtubers who could stand to learn from this.
cutie pie
the outdoor scene took me by surprise. it was so beautiful i thought the apple feature you were reviewing was &quot;green screen&quot;
another thing with casting, you can even cast streaming services from an iphone to the mac! i like it when i connect my mac to say a projector and i can control the movie or show i’m watching without having to get up!
after watching the videos, i realized i dont use most of the features lol i guess i wont be buying any apple products
this is different and a relief 👍👍
i switched to samsung in 2022 but when i upgrade again i think i might go back to iphone which i&#39;ve had since the 3
the watch as a camera  preview on the phone is super genius, will have to try that with my galaxy watch4 and s22 ultra!
would be nice if airdrop was just a tap on the phone like contacts
succinct! such great videos and hny 2024 to you, ella 🫶🏼
how don’t you already have a million subs lmao your stuff is top tier
it would be great if u made a video of samsung ecosystem. 😊
i loved this video always so thorough!! thx ella😊😊❤
happy new year. your videos are really good and they’re getting better. i hope you keep getting better. i see you. you are really good at this and you really enjoy it good for you.
very nice video
happy new year ella! it&#39;s so crazy and amusing how fast you grew, i swear the first time i saw your video was when you uploaded the s21 unboxing and have been watching you ever since. you were just a little channel at that time but now, you are so many people&#39;s choices for tech reviews. i wish you all the best and i hope good things are coming your way
i thought apples white usb c cables are usb 2.0 and dont really transfer data too well. i doubt that it would help screen mirroring on ipad tho? anyone here whos more knowledgable?
ella, clean your mac display 😂
so os, that would be a five out five star apple ecosystem video. i really like the explanation on how the iwatch can control the iphone camera and the iphone can pair up with a macbook to become the web cam of the macbook, so os good tricks let me tell you that much. excellent filming skills.  happy new year!!! 😺😍📱🎥⭐️💎
great video, this has been really useful! you’ve convinced me that a mac and ipad is a great pairing, but you haven’t convinced me that an iphone is essential in this mix with google and third party apps. while i am mostly in the apple ecosystem with a mac and an ipad, i don’t feel that i’m missing out anything with my android phone and third party earbuds… plus i don’t wear a watch. i do most of what you’ve shown anyway, just with different 3rd party apps.
i&#39;m not an apple fan. but the ecosystem is probably not worth it for the average person. it is pretty expensive, not to mention unnecessary.
god bless u ella❤❤❤ apple ecosystem is masterpiece, but i still love samsung&#39;s ecosystem
crz that samsung can do like 70% of these things and their own stuff today as well, like 3 yrs ago they had nothing
please never leave youtube
hey ella! i hope you could make a video about great and maybe cheaper, and better alternatives for the iphone 15. i love your videos!
superb quality in every possible way. you are one of my favorite reviewers.
jennie kim is she?🤔
i also use google docs for all my notes as well because its fast, feature rich and cross platform. as someone who prefers a samsung phone paired with a macbook, i find ecosystems to be overrated and even more so that nowadays everythings syncs with almost everything else. only really useful feature in an ecosystem to me is universal copy and paste but even that has a simple workaround when using a samsung and a mac
don’t forget the fact that you can add widgets from iphone and ipad to macos with cotinuity
other companies like samsung and huawei(even tho it’s banned in many countries) are catching up and sometimes do even better than apple in these ecosystem features!<br>some gripes i have abt apple ecosystem:<br>why can’t airplay or screen mirror from iphone to ipad and use the projected iphone screen in ipad (it would be nice to use the iphone like a slide-over app in ipad)<br>why can’t we control iphone,ipad using mac (like how we can do in windows os) rather than just screen mirroring<br>there’s literally no functionality benefits bw apple watch and ipad<br>why can’t we control ipad’s camera using iphone and vice-versa<br>why can’t we use iphone like a remote/cursor for ipad (to sell magic trackpads probably)<br><br>with the amount of features it’s lacking compared to its competition rn, i think apple ecosystem is really overrated, it feels like it’s mainly focusing on locking in the users in the walled garden rather than adding new and useful features
many youtubers don’t say it’s not that reliable<br>even some famous ones, they act like all these features work flawlessly <br>thanks for pointing out flaws, i also experience these glitches frequently
i really wanna see the samsung ecosystem video now, and please be objective when doing that. don&#39;t forget to mention when the connection drops or when the buds don&#39;t want to connect for some reason, if this happens for you, because if it was apple these stuff will get pointed out.
looking forward to the samsung video
as a ui designer, i cannot emphasise how convenient the side car function is. i simply place my ipad near my mac and i can instantly see my design on it, not to mention you can use your ipad as a screen extension not just mirroring ❤
good video. i would love to see a vid about the google ecosystem.<br>can&#39;t forget about apple tv and airtag though.
use the samsung eco system. i think it&#39;s better
i have the same problems with airpods switching from my mac to iphone when sound on my phone😮
i had the same issue with my airpods always preferring my phone, but now it works pretty well switching between other devices.
would be perfect do same with samsung :)
would love to see the battle of ecosystems between apple and samsung<br>❤
great video and implementation coming from someone who isn&#39;t in the apple ecosystem. thanks!
loving the new video style 👌 . it&#39;s like a tech info  show 😉 . happy new year ella 😘 🌹 💞
im not buying any of these, i just love ella💞.
next is samsung pleaeeeee😭🥹
you missed the apple tv.
i have  products from different brands and i’m not very impressed by apple ecosystem. i’m good with a mixed ecosystem. apple ecosystem is overated.
nice review❤
nicely done. have an awesome 2024.
great video as always ,cant wait for the samsung ecosystem one.<br>crazy how youre almost at 400k subs. i remember when you were at 100k. crazy to see how much your channel has grown in subs.
connect your phone by wire to macbook and backup after that airpods change source very quickly.
she wears watch both on right and left wrist!?
excellent video! no waffle and straight to the point. love it!!
you have come so far, so fast! i remember your first nintendo switch video. its really incredible to see the hard work you have and continue to put into these helpful/entertaining videos. youre gonna be on top! 🎉 happy 2024 ella!
your editing and production just keeps getting better and better ella! i hope 2024 brings you all the success you deserve, 1 million here you come! much love from the uk 💜
wow
ella marry me!
dirty screens make me very anxious but great video :d
happy new year ella! i always love these review style videos from you, well presented, giving us all the info we need. 🙂 i&#39;d love to see a samsung ecosystem version 🤩<br><br>i really don&#39;t think the apple ecosystem is better. i&#39;d prefer to have a windows laptop, samsung phone, samsung earbuds, samsung galaxy watch and the samsung smart tag, samsung tablet + s pen, the list goes on. <br>( windows laptop, ipad, and samsung phone is my preffered setup. )<br><br>plus, some of the samsung products have cross compatibility. i have an iphone 12 right now and knew i&#39;d not invest in anymore of the ecosystem, as i&#39;ve always had samsung/android and just wanted a change, i can download the galaxy buds/galaxy watch apps, and they work as any normal bluetooth earbuds would, i have an equalizer and other settings in the app that are identical to the airpods. <br>i&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t invest in this ecosystem, they&#39;re are many people who love apple, and i guess it&#39;s alot to do with influence and what you are used to, and personally like to work with, for example; if your parents have iphones, they&#39;d be more likely to get you an iphone, and so you&#39;d start to without intention, invest in their accessories.<br><br>the samsung galaxybook, which i don&#39;t see as a benefit? they come running windows 10 or chromeos, it&#39;s not like the galaxybooks run dex which i&#39;d like to see as a new flagship operating system to compete with microsoft / macbooks .
nice
&quot;it works like magic...&quot; ~ steve jobs quote from the first iphone keynote
i actually don’t like apple’s solution for airpod connection to multiple devices. i like sony’s far better — they can pair to multiple devices at once, and they play from whichever is playing sound. so if you opened something on the phone and it took control of the sound, as soon as you closed it and resumed on the laptop, sound returns to the laptop. there’s no pairing handover. <br><br>because the airpod implementation stinks. i’ll have them paired to my phone, listening to a podcast. then my mac will make a notification sound, and the airpods will switch over to the mac and not return to the iphone without me manually doing it. <br><br>when a sony product (xm5 over the ear headphones in my case) handles use with an iphone / mac combo better than apple’s products do… come on apple, you can do better.
the cross device copy and paste is called universal clipboard
i think gou should do one on the anroid ecosystem, not just samsung.
awesome video ella! happy new year🎉
love your videos 👍 have a great year.
generally, the best parts of the ecosystem is airpods phone and either the ipad or mac (not both even tho apple will convince you otherwise). the more you add the nicer it gets, but obviously the more expensive it all becomes. the core essentials imo are what i mentioned.
nice video. looking forward to the samsung one
universal control and sidecar where deal breakers for me to get a galaxy tab for college. those alone are super great, for writing some text and doing a bit of coding on the campus, without getting headaches to connect and make it work!
most of those features exist with the samsung ecosystem. but i think the apple one is more seamless and easy to use. with samsung, you have to activate some parameters, or even worse install some specific samsung apps (for example, if you are using your galaxy buds, samsung wear has to install at first the add-on for buds). if you use the samsung smart tag, you have to install samsung smart things and activate some parameters in order for it to be detectable by others samsung smartphones...
i wish you would test the samsung ecosystem
will we see this but for samsung?
i just do not understand the whole point of airdrop. maybe i am just a boomer, but everybody i know just sends photos to each other. through whatsapp or telegram. i do not understand the need to be next to someone and airdrop when you can just send it to them.
and your videos are always great! great job!
for sidecar, you can remove that boarder on your ipad and use the entire screen! 10/10 would recommend :d
airdrop/universal clipboard have been so buggy for the last ~6 months. they used to work perfectly almost every time 😭
video was fire! lots of things didn&#39;t knew about apple ecosystem.. and, video quality its 10/10, looks so crispy at 4k. oh, bytheway, you look fantastic as always ☺️
ummh, my experience with apple notes is different, the notes syncing is instantaneously with my experience...
thank you, this was an excellent video.  since 1996, i have been using apple computers both desktops and laptops.  also, since the introduction of their basic ipad 4th generation, i have owned a basic ipad and my current model is the 9th generation.  however, i have never wanted to join the complete apple ecosystem.  so, i have never owned an iphone, apple watch, or home pod (smile...smile).
you should do google product also. we know samsung  and apple are good
love your videos. i think you are being very generous with your ratings. i haven&#39;t been able to get everything you list here to work flawlessly.
pick one -  iphone or samsung
the ecosystem is worth the hype i think. the main advantage with continuity cam apart from video quality is center stage in my opinion. great if you’re 2 in front of the computer for instance.
fantastic video. have to say, apple ecosystem is stunning. but the no repair-mentality drags me away very, very fast...
excellent video, thanks ella for taking the time to do this.
really interesting video. can you make a video on how the same synchronization can also work between devices that can happen in android and windows ecosystem?
great video, thanks!  i have an apple ecosystem too, and probably the one feature i use the most is universal control between my desktop computer and my laptop, it&#39;s really convenient.  oh, and i finally subscribed 🙂
no simple answer...its for shills
can&#39;t wait for the samsung ecosystem vid
i think your videos is perfect ❤
amazing content ella :)
no need to start you did press your lock and volume up button right it will show slide to power off then please exit and your device will ask for a password as if it is restarted i have tried and it is like restart without restarting it.
amazing video
i really cant understand how apple hasn&#39;t brought continuity copy/paste to the homepod. \s
great video. i would give apple notes a zero out of five. horrible sync with icloud. sometimes i have to wait an hour before my notes sync with all three of my devices. and sometimes they never sync. i am sticking with my evernote with real-time sync.
very nice video<br>i&#39;m waiting for the samsung video 😉
quick anwser so you don&#39;t have to watch it all: no, its not worth it
love your videos!
you have all these americans say buy american but it is not really american is it? apple is too cheap to have it made in the us so it is made in china and i have no problem with chinese product i have many of them but then i&#39;m not going to say buy american either america makes nothing anyway but then anyway i have the samsung s23 ultra and it will match up against any iphone anyway of course it&#39;s made in south korea but then i also have a samsung tablet and my very expensive samsung tv so personally everybody that likes apple can have it i&#39;ll stick with the samsung any day
ella❤❤❤😊
happy new year!
that&#39;s great. what mac is that? m3 pro and which iphone is that? give the colors too.thanks
one benefit for mirroring your ipads to your mac is for online presentation and school. it&#39;s so convenient for such purpose, no need to buy any extra peripherals like a capture card. this method also eliminates the weird camera angle and also the disturbing noise of the pen making contact with the ipad screen.
thanks! this is what intrigues me the most(tied with ported aaa games) on apple products.<br><br>happy new year!
how about using samsung phone with a macbook ? dowes that affect productivity?
you are aproaching 400k. so happy to see your channel grows. i was there back when you have 30k plus ^^
apple 🍎
i used most of this only once and then meh, not needed it
useful succinct accurate info. well presented. the channel is growing because of substance and style.
i&#39;m in the samsung ecosystem, with a bit of google sprinkled in
this video is crisp and precise🔥, have a great year ella.
happy new year ella🎉🎉🎉🎉
well written and produced, good work, would love to see the samsung ecosystem too
i am 10 minutes early and hope to get a heart
if i could afford it i definitely would get a macbook. but i cant afford it so ill stick with my iphone and the new laptop i got a couple days ago
i don&#39;t know why ending talking about samsung? did you merged the wrong vidro? 😅
no. don&#39;t want an ecosystem that babies me. let me have the control.
do you only do youtube?
aaaaaaaahhh
look at our android girl all grown up now.   we need another android girl to rise up and join parker buton and technically alex. all jokes. nice content
but didn&#39;t win the samsung video the poll?
ella, are you a sister of jennie blackpink?
hola ella
can i get noticed ❤
heyy, i am first
first !
