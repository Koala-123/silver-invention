the so-called benefit of having all my apple devices seamlessly buzzing and distracting me together is one i&#39;ve started moving away from. i want clear separation from different aspects of my life.<br><br>email and social media is strictly a computer thing now. i don&#39;t want it on any other portable device constantly with me.<br>i have a dumb phone for calls and messages. no whatsapp or apple messages.<br>i have an ipad for fun stuff like online banking, games, creative apps, but absolutely no social media is on there.<br>i&#39;ve gone back to a mechanical watch that just gives me the time without beeping and vibrating at me all day.<br><br>my desktop is a windows pc and my laptop a macbook pro. i rarely use the laptop.<br><br>i&#39;ve been addicted to apple stuff since the iphone 3gs came out. i&#39;m finally at the point where i&#39;m ready to step away from most of it.
i can&#39;t agree more, the only thing is i prefer the diversity. monopoly leads to lower innovation. as multiple companies develop individually they offer a lot of innovation with a trade off of not having one unified system. as for imessage, i&#39;m not in the usa and i don&#39;t get how important it is, apple&#39;s plan to support rcs has taken care of that non the less.
ecosystem is a bullshit to lock yourself into something.
i&#39;m an android user. i help my family with their iphones cause i know tech. i dislike sooo many things. they are behind in soo many features. and there are sooo many small annoyances i can&#39;t even list them. i wouldnt use an iphone even if someone paid me. but i&#39;m glad you enjoy your devices
i think reason 5 goes just in the us. because in europe not all people use iphone nor imessage nor facetime. instead whatsapp is more likely used by people.
airdrop does also on android exist (it is nearby share) and with windows link you can also easily switch between your phone and laptop or pc
next time do less with slides and show more videos or something
agreed. but the only thing that i feel is missing is the ability to game. if only apple could provide a good gaming experience, it would be a 10/10 for me. i own a macbook pro only because i just love the overall experience of a mac over any windows laptop, but from time to time, i do miss having the ability to play games.
i adore apple. i got the ipad pro and apple pencil and magic keyboard, that led to my first iphone and i recently got a macbook air. ðŸ’» the ecosystem is essential
